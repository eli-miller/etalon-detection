MissingOutputException in rule run_etalon_detection in file /Users/elimiller/Documents/1Research/python_project/etalon_detection_analysis/src/Snakefile, line 10:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/Users/elimiller/Documents/1Research/python_project/etalon_detection_analysis/output/bs_telescope/computer_1_wideband
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
